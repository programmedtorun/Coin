This file explains the format of the whale_conf.json file and gives an example.

the whale_conf.json file will be a hash of hashes, the keys of the hashes are coin ticker
symbol. each hash will have keys "symbol" (token ticker), "wh_buys_20m" (list of hashes with
buy info from only the last 20 min)-the app will sense if there is something in this list, if there
is a buy then trigger an alarm, the alarm will send a text and email with the recent buy amount
and also all big buy history (can also eventually pull in tokenomics API data from CMC as brief
summary, this will be a bit later)



Every 20 min if there are no big buys for a token the wh_buys_20m list will be deleted. if there
are remaining big buys from a token in the wh_buys_20m list from the previous 20 min time segment
the app will delete these (and write new ones if there are any, or it will be left blank if not).
any big buy will be permenantly written to "all_wh_buys" list
